# SP1 - Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent

## Getting Started

First, make sure that Docker (Desktop) is installed. Installation instructions can be found in the [official documentation] (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To start the compose in VS Code or with the command line, follow the steps below:

### Starting with VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Install the necessary [extensions for Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and Docker Compose if you haven't already.
3. Right-click on the [compose.yaml](/compose.yaml) file and then click on `Compose up`.

### Starting with the Command Line

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
3. Run the following command to start the compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

This will start the compose and build the necessary containers. You can then log in with the token `hwr`.
